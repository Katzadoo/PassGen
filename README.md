# PassGen
I created a basic Password and Passphrase generator called PassGen! Its just a small personal project that I worked on to learn python a bit more. This is by no means a full proof password generator, this was made for testing purposes, I am not liable should anything happen because of it.


Anyways, now that all the formalities are out of the way all you need to do is make sure that the wordlist.txt is in the same folder as the program, then all you need to do is run it and you should be good! I have added the exe file. It hasnt been tested over different computers so if any problems arise let me know please!

As long as the wordlist is in the same folder as the EXE(executable) it should run, even if you dont have python installed.

The program is pretty simple and guides you through it but if theres any suggestions dont hesitate to let me know :D


Thanks for checking out my program!
